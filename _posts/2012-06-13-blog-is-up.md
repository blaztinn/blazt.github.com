Finally I hacked together a simple blog.

I will be using this blog mostly to write about my
computer-related work and experience. I also hope that I will
be able to write some tutorials on different things I am currently working on.

## Technology

I created this blog using [Jekyll] [1]. It's quite a nice
tool for simple non-dynamic blog sites and
I like that it requires some programming to make use of it.
I am not that good at creating websites so I used
[Jekyll Bootstrap] [2] framework which includes already created
templates, themes and most of the other stuff you need to deploy a
Jekyll based blog. I am recommending it to all new users of Jekyll.
